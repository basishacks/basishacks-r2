# Pages

The basishacks frontend contains **27 page files** in `app/pages/`, mapped to routes via Nuxt's file-based routing. All pages use `<script setup lang="ts">`.

## Public Pages

### `/` (index)

**File:** `app/pages/index.vue`

The home page. Fetches the active hackathon season from `/api/seasons/active` and renders:

- **Welcome message** with the `WEBSITE_NAME` constant
- **Status alert** — links to `/dashboard` when the hackathon has started or finished
- **Schedule section** — conditionally renders `LargeCountdown` components based on hackathon status:

| Status        | Countdowns shown                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `not_started` | Hackathon starts, Hackathon ends |
| `in_progress` | Hackathon ends, Voting starts    |
| `voting`      | Voting ends, Results released    |
| `paused`      | Maintenance message              |
| `finished`    | No countdowns                    |

- **Detailed schedule** — collapsible section with `DateTime` components for all timestamps
- **Theme section** — reveals theme name and description once set, otherwise shows a countdown to the start date
- **Resources section** — links to last year's showcase and the rules page

**Layout:** `default`

```vue
// No auth required
```

### `/profile`

**File:** `app/pages/profile.vue`

User profile editing page. Protected by `auth` middleware.

**Features:**

- Displays greeting with user name or email
- **Name editing** — text input validated by `UpdateUserRequest`
- **Avatar upload** — `UFileUpload` with live preview via `UserAvatar`. Supports removing the current avatar. Converts uploaded files to base64 before sending.
- **Profile theme image** — `UFileUpload` for background image. Displays the current theme as a CSS background. Affects the user's profile page (`/user/{id}`) and `UserPopover` card.
- **Logout button** — clears the session and navigates to `/`

**API:** `PATCH /api/users/{id}` with body containing `name`, `avatar` (base64 or null), `profile_theme_image` (base64 or null).

**Layout:** `default`

### `/rules`

**File:** `app/pages/rules.vue`

Static rules page listing hackathon requirements:

- Open-source repository (GitHub or Gitee)
- README file
- Public demo URL (with specific rules for websites, desktop apps, games, and mobile apps)
- Demo video (1–3 minutes)
- Theme adherence

**Layout:** `default`

### `/showcase`

**File:** `app/pages/showcase/index.vue`

Season showcase index. The featured top section links to the current Beneath the Surface experience, and the archive section beneath it links to the previous Signal experience.

**Layout:** `fullwidth-nostick`

### `/showcase/signal`

**File:** `app/pages/showcase/signal.vue`

Animated Signal showcase for the previous season's top projects. A highly visual, scroll-driven experience.

**Layout:** `fullwidth-nostick`

**Sections:**

| Section | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Title | Full-screen landscape background with "When there is Signal" title, neon flicker animation |
| Team #1 | Scroll-driven video playback, cursor-following gold aura effect, slide-right description transition |
| Team #2 | Word-by-word shake animation for project name, metallic silver styling, dual image layout |
| Team #3 | Slide-left transition, metallic bronze styling, window mockup with screenshot |
| All Projects | Dual `UMarquee` carousels of `ShowcaseMarqueeCard` components, clickable to open a project modal |

**Scroll-driven animations:**

- Team #1 video: `currentTime` is set proportional to scroll position within the section
- Team #2 and #3: visibility triggers when elements enter the viewport
- "Scroll for more" indicator fades out after scrolling past 25% viewport height

**Preloading:** Images and videos are preloaded via `<link rel="preload">` in `useHead`.

**Components used:** `GoBackUp`, `LoaderAnimation`, `ResultsProjectLinks`, `ShowcaseMarqueeCard`, `ProjectCard`

::: tip This page uses custom CSS animations including `metallic-gold`, `metallic-silver`, `metallic-bronze`, `neon` flicker, and `appearAndShake` word animations. :::

### `/showcase/beneath-the-surface`

**File:** `app/pages/showcase/beneath-the-surface.vue`

Season 1's data-driven winners showcase for **Beneath the Surface**. Its `ShowcaseBeneathTheSurface` component fetches `/api/teams?season_id=1` and merges the public records with a frozen historical winner configuration.

**Layout:** `fullwidth-nostick`

| Pathway | Rank | Project                    |
| ------- | ---- | -------------------------- |
| Junior  | 1    | Where the Rainbow Ends     |
| Junior  | 2    | Beneath the Land           |
| Junior  | 3    | Horror Forest              |
| Senior  | 1    | metadata manipulation tool |
| Senior  | 2    | Unseen Layers              |
| Senior  | 3    | TraceShadow                |

Each winner receives a full-viewport, project-specific visual chapter. Project names, team names, and links come from the Season 1 API; the frozen title and summary remain visible if a record cannot be loaded. "Open project" launches a `UModal` with the shared `ProjectCard` using the already loaded public team record, while the repository button links out directly. The hero and closing headings use Unbounded, and each chapter heading uses its own locally hosted display font (Orbitron, Silkscreen, Creepster, Space Mono, Cormorant Garamond, Chakra Petch). Ranks appear as shimmering metallic `#1`/`#2`/`#3` medals (gold/silver/bronze, like the previous season), and pathways as sonar chips labeled junior or senior.

**Motion:** GSAP and ScrollTrigger create the hero entrance, depth progress, desktop pinned sections, scroll-linked reveals, ambient layers, and pointer parallax. Mobile layouts use natural scrolling. `prefers-reduced-motion` disables pinning, scrubbing, parallax, and ambient movement while keeping all content visible.

**Components used:** `ShowcaseBeneathTheSurface`, `GoBackUp`

### `/voting`

**File:** `app/pages/voting.vue`

Peer voting page. Protected by `auth` middleware. Only accessible during the `voting` hackathon status.

**Flow:**

1. Fetches ballot data from `/api/ballot`
2. Displays eligible `VotingProjectCard` components in a grid
3. User distributes **10 stars** among eligible projects (0–5 per project)
4. Increment/decrement buttons with validation (total must equal 10)
5. Reasoning textarea
6. Submit with browser `confirm()` dialog

**Validation:** Uses `SubmitVoteRequest` schema. Posts to `/api/ballot`.

**Layout:** `default`

### `/contributing`

**File:** `app/pages/contributing.vue`

Contributing guidelines and security disclosure policy. Contains commit guidelines, instructions for privately reporting security issues (with guidance on self-fixing via obfuscated pull requests), a responsible disclosure policy, and a code of conduct. Written in professional academic American English. Linked from the site footer.

**Layout:** `default`

## Judging Pages

### `/judging`

**File:** `app/pages/judging/index.vue`

Judge landing page. Protected by `auth` middleware. Accessible only by judges or admins during the `voting` status.

**Guards:**

- Redirects to `/` if hackathon status is not `voting`
- Redirects to `/` if user lacks judge or admin permissions

**Content:**

- Static summary of participation statistics
- **Current Evaluations** section — shows `JudgeProgressCard` for the active season
- **Past Evaluations** section — shows `JudgeProgressCard` entries for past seasons with at least one scored team
- **Continue** button — navigates to `/judging/continue`

**Layout:** `default`

### `/judging/continue`

**File:** `app/pages/judging/continue.vue`

Active judging interface. Protected by `auth` middleware. Accessible only by judges or admins during the `voting` status.

**Flow:**

1. Fetches teams for judging from `/api/teams?judging=1`
2. Renders a `JudgingCard` for each team (project descriptions rendered via `SafeComark`)
3. After scoring, refreshes the list

**Layout:** `default`

## Dashboard Pages

### `/dashboard`

**File:** `app/pages/dashboard/index.vue`

Main dashboard overview. Protected by `auth` middleware. Uses `dashboard` layout.

**Features:**

- Welcome message with status-dependent text (not started, in progress, voting, finished, paused)
- If no team: prompt to create or join a team
- If has team: `ProjectCard` showing the current project
- Action cards linking to General, Teams, and Results pages
- **Confetti animation** — helper functions exist for ranks 1–10 but are not automatically triggered on mount

**Unsaved changes protection:** Listens for `onBeforeRouteLeave` and `beforeunload` events.

**Layout:** `dashboard`

### `/dashboard/general`

**File:** `app/pages/dashboard/general.vue`

Project editing page. Protected by `auth` middleware.

**States:**

- No team and hackathon not started → "Hackathon not started yet!" CTA
- No team and hackathon started → "You don't have a team yet!" CTA
- Has team → `ProjectForm` (disabled when submission is closed or already submitted)
- Project already submitted → congratulations message with disabled form

**XSS-safe content:** All user-provided project content (descriptions, sourcing notes) is rendered using `SafeComark` throughout the page, which sanitizes inline Markdown and replaces `<a>` tags with `SafeLink` to prevent unsafe URLs.

**Unsaved changes protection:** Same pattern as dashboard index — `onBeforeRouteLeave` + `beforeunload`.

**Layout:** `dashboard`

### `/dashboard/teams`

**File:** `app/pages/dashboard/teams/index.vue`

Team creation and management. Protected by `auth` middleware.

**States:**

- No team → `CreateTeamRequest` form (team name only)
- Has team → `TeamForm` component

**Layout:** `dashboard`

### `/dashboard/results`

**File:** `app/pages/dashboard/results.vue`

Season results page. Protected by `auth` middleware.

**Content:**

- Current season results via `ScoreCard`
- Past season results via `ScoreCard` for each `past_teams` entry

**Layout:** `dashboard`

### `/dashboard/presentation`

**File:** `app/pages/dashboard/presentation.vue`

Placeholder page for the presentation event. States that top 10 teams will be invited to present.

**Layout:** `dashboard`

## Mod Portal

**Access:** Home, users, teams, DeepSeek, files, and season management require admin permission. The applications portal remains granular: application view, view-all, and create permissions grant access to their corresponding application routes; all other developer routes return a hard 403 for non-admin users.

### `/developers`

**File:** `app/pages/developers/index.vue`

Mod portal landing page. Shows a welcome message. Wrapped in `UDashboardPanel` with `UDashboardNavbar` and `UDashboardSidebarCollapse` so mobile users can open the sidebar navigation.

**Layout:** `developers-dashboard`

### `/developers/users`

**File:** `app/pages/developers/users.vue`

User management page.

**Layout:** `developers-dashboard`

### `/developers/teams`

**File:** `app/pages/developers/teams.vue`

Team management page.

The table includes a **Members** column that renders a `UserAvatarGroup` (with `developer-mode` enabled, so hovering shows each member's id beside their name) fed by the `members` array returned from `GET /api/admin/teams`.

**Layout:** `developers-dashboard`

### `/developers/deepseek`

**File:** `app/pages/developers/deepseek.vue`

DeepSeek AI chat interface.

**Layout:** `developers-dashboard`

### `/developers/debug`

**File:** `app/pages/developers/debug.vue`

File upload and debug utilities. Permission-gated.

**Layout:** `developers-dashboard`

### `/developers/season`

**File:** `app/pages/developers/season.vue`

Hackathon Administration page (admin-only, hard 403 for non-admins). Contains:

- **Season** — pick the season to manage and activate it (`PATCH /api/seasons/active`); "New Season" creates one via `POST /api/admin/seasons`.
- **Season Name** — rename the selected season via `PATCH /api/admin/seasons`.
- **Hackathon Configuration** — all settings are per-season (including score and rank visibility) and auto-save through `/api/admin/hackathon` with `season_id`. Editing the active season also syncs to the global `hackathon` row. No "Save" button; every field change is persisted via a serialized PATCH chain carrying all form fields, so no field is ever dropped and no two PATCHes race.
- **Database Export** — download the SQLite database or a CSV snapshot via `GET /api/admin/database/export`.

**Layout:** `developers-dashboard`

## Login Flow

`/api/login` redirects directly to basis-auth, so basishacks no longer renders a native authorization or consent page. basis-auth owns provider login and consent UI; basishacks handles only its callback and local session.

## User Profile

### `/user/[id]`

**File:** `app/pages/user/[id].vue`

Public user profile page.

**Features:**

- Fetches user data from `/api/users/{id}`
- If the user has a `profile_theme` with mode `url`, sets the background image from `/userast/{value}`
- Full-height container with default background overlay

**Layout:** `fullwidth` (set programmatically via `setPageLayout`)

### `/user`

**File:** `app/pages/user/index.vue`

Redirects an authenticated user to their own profile page (`/user/{id}`). If the user is not logged in, redirects to `/login`.

## Debug

### `/debug`

**File:** `app/pages/debug.vue`

Admin-only debug page with two tabs:

- **File Upload** — upload files to `/assets` or `/userast`, list uploaded files, and copy permalinks
- **DeepSeek Chat** — create chat sessions, send messages, and delete sessions via `/api/debug/deepseek/sessions`

Protected by `auth` middleware and an admin permission check.
