# Testing

The `basishacks` project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) for unit and integration testing. The goal of the test suite is to give every contributor confidence that changes to authentication, voting, scoring, team management, and OAuth2 flows do not break existing behavior.

## Running the Test Suite

Use the following npm/Bun scripts:

```bash
# Run the full suite once
bun run test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
bun run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage reporting
bun run test:coverage
```

The canonical command is `bun run test`, which executes `vitest run --pool=forks --reporter=json | bun run test:meta`. This resolves Nuxt's `~~/` and `~/` path aliases through `vitest.config.ts`, loads `tests/setup.ts` before each test file, and automatically generates `tests/.test-meta.json` with the current test count. The `test:meta` script reads the vitest JSON output from stdin and writes a summary file used by the VitePress documentation's `<TestCount />` component for dynamic test count display.

## Coverage Policy

The project maintains **100% line, branch, function, and statement coverage** on all tracked source files. `bun run test:coverage` will fail if any new code is added without corresponding tests.

### Current Coverage Status

The test suite currently has **<TestCount /> passing tests** across **87 test files**. All server utility files (`server/utils/*.ts`) maintain 100% coverage.

### Coverage Exclusions

The following files and directories are excluded from coverage because they are configuration, generated artifacts, test infrastructure, or documentation:

- `nuxt.config.ts` — Nuxt configuration
- `tests/**/helpers.ts` — Test-only helper modules
- `bun-shim/**` — Bun test runner shim
- `drizzle/**` — Generated migration SQL and metadata snapshots
- `sql/archive/**` — Historical SQL archives
- `documentation/**` — VitePress documentation site
- `**/*.d.ts` — TypeScript declaration files
- `**/node_modules/**` — Third-party dependencies

These exclusions are configured in `vitest.config.ts` under `test.coverage.exclude`.

## Test Organization

Tests live in the `tests/` directory and mirror the project structure:

| Directory                      | Contents                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `tests/api/`                   | API route handlers (`server/api/**`)        |
| `tests/server/utils/`          | Server utilities and helpers                |
| `tests/server/utils/database/` | Database helper functions                   |
| `tests/server/middleware/`     | Nitro middleware                            |
| `tests/server/plugins/`        | Nitro plugins                               |
| `tests/server/database/`       | Database initialization and migration logic |
| `tests/shared/`                | Shared schemas, permissions, rubric, etc.   |
| `tests/components/`            | Vue components                              |
| `tests/composables/`           | Vue composables                             |
| `tests/pages/`                 | Nuxt pages                                  |
| `tests/middleware/`            | Route middleware                            |
| `tests/frontend/`              | Frontend-specific behavior                  |

## Writing Tests

Tests use Vitest's global API (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, `vi`) and the project-specific helpers in `tests/api/helpers.ts` and `tests/utils/database/helpers.ts`. When testing API routes, prefer creating a minimal H3 event and invoking the route handler directly, mocking external dependencies such as `fetch`, `jose`, and `nuxt-auth-utils` as needed.

If you add a new branch to a source file, add a test that exercises it. The CI pipeline runs `bun run test:coverage` and will reject pull requests that reduce coverage below 100%.

## About `bun test`

Do not use Bun's native test runner (`bun test`) for this project. It cannot resolve Nuxt's `~~/` and `~/` path aliases, and the test files import assertions from `vitest` rather than `bun:test`.

To prevent accidental use, `bunfig.toml` scopes `bun test` to a single shim (`bun-shim/shim.test.ts`) that prints guidance directing you to `bun run test` instead. The shim exits successfully so `bun test` never appears to fail silently.

## Legacy Test Scripts

`tests/index.js`, `tests/test.oauth2.js`, `tests/test.microsoft.ts`, and `tests/test.deepseek.ts` are legacy manual test runners kept for reference. They are not part of the active Vitest suite and do not contribute to coverage.
